## How to Get Started

The files are organized in a priority order to facilitate learning. I recommend following the sequence below, starting with the most basic concepts and progressing to more complex topics:

1. `bibliotecas_basicas.ipynb`: This is the starting point to learn how to use tools that will be necessary for the other topics.
2. `list_comprehension.ipynb`: Move on to list_comprehension.ipynb to master this data manipulation technique.
3. `modulos_pacotes.ipynb`: Explore modulos_pacotes.ipynb to understand how to organize and import code.
4. `tratamento_arquivos.ipynb`: Practice with tratamento_arquivos.ipynb to learn how to handle files.
5. `excecoes_tratamento_erros.ipynb`: Finish with excecoes_tratamento_erros.ipynb to handle errors professionally.
