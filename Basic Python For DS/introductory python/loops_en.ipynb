        "# For and While Loops in Python for Data Science\n",
        "\n",
        "Loops **for** and **while** are fundamental tools in Python for automating repetitive tasks, such as processing large datasets, cleaning data, or performing iterative calculations. In data science, they are widely used to iterate over DataFrame rows, filter data, or run simulations. This notebook explores the use of loops with practical examples, best practice tips, and real-world applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objectives\n",
        "- Understand how to use **for** loops to iterate over lists, dictionaries, and DataFrames.\n",
        "- Apply **while** loops for processing based on dynamic conditions.\n",
        "- Combine loops with common data structures in data science.\n",
        "- Learn best practices to avoid inefficient loops and common errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why Are Loops Important?\n",
        "In data science, you often need to process thousands or millions of records. Loops allow you to automate tasks such as:\n",
        "- Categorizing data (e.g., classifying customers by age group).\n",
        "- Filtering information (e.g., finding outliers in a column).\n",
        "- Transforming data (e.g., applying a formula to each row).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: While loops are powerful, in data science, vectorized operations (using libraries like NumPy or Pandas) are generally more efficient for large datasets. This notebook focuses on loops for scenarios where they are appropriate or necessary."
