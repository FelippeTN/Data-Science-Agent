## How to Get Started

The files are organized in a priority order to facilitate learning. I recommend following the sequence below, starting with the most basic concepts and progressing to more complex topics:

1. `variavel.ipynb`: Learn the basics of variables, which are the foundation for working with data in Python.
2. `condicionais.ipynb`: Understand how to use conditional structures (`if`, `else`, `elif`) to make decisions in your code.
3. `loops_pt.ipynb`: Discover how to use loops (`for` and `while`) to repeat actions efficiently.
4. `estrutura_dados.ipynb`: Explore Python's main data structures, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
5. `funcoes.ipynb`: Learn how to create and use functions to organize and reuse your code.
6. `classes.ipynb`: Get to know the basics of object-oriented programming with classes in Python.
